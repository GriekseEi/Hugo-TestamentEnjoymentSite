## ME

I like thinking about why videogames ended up the way they did, and why they didn't end up as something else.

I also like Testament from Guilty Gear a lot. Please don't ask me which design of them I like the most. I'll cry.

## MY SITE

Me making my own blog was long overdue, but I always kept putting it off due to my dislike of doing any web design, owing to a lot of fiddly experiences in college.
In the past I kept most of my writings on *Backloggd* and the late *Cohost*, but with the former not allowing more generalized game design articles and the latter getting deep-sixed, this approach was no longer viable.

This changed in 2024 after I got big time into playing *SpikeOut*, one of the first and best 3D beat 'em ups. It was a hidden gem in every sense of the word, yet there were only very few English knowledge sources on it, its versions, how to play it, or how to even set it up. Much of it was scattered between sources or incomplete. So, I took it upon myself to fill in the gaps. This also meant needing to have some kind of central online repository that I could easily share.

In 2025 I finally bit the bullet by trying my hand at making a personal blog using the *Hugo* static site generator. Compared to how long I was messing around in college trying to get only a basic website looking as I wanted... *Hugo* made doing that so, *so* much easier. You pick a *Hugo* theme that you like, you write your articles in *Markdown*, and that's really it. No endless fiddling with getting the layouts and element positions just right. Well... after that you start overriding bits and pieces of your chosen theme to make some visual tweaks here and there. Then before you know it, you spent several days rebuilding entire theme elements to your liking and adding new ones. Turns out that all I needed to get over my dislike of front-end web design was a solid template to build off of.
